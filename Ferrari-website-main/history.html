            <h2>Ferrari's 3.0 L V12 Engine</h2>
            <section>
                <img src="images/Ferrari_F1_V12_engine_(22383293983).jpg" alt="Ferrari 3.0L V12 Engine" style="float: right; margin: 10px; width: 250px;">
                <p>The <strong>Ferrari Tipo 044/1</strong> was the last V12 engine used by Ferrari in Formula 1 before transitioning to a V10 in 1996. This engine was a response to major FIA regulation changes following tragic events in the previous season. </p>
                <p>The 75° V12 was reduced from <strong>3.5 to 3.0 litres</strong> to comply with new rules. Despite the downsizing, it produced around <strong>700 hp (522 kW) at 17,000 rpm</strong> in race trim. In qualifying, it was capable of reaching <strong>760 hp</strong> in its highest state of tune.</p>
                <p>While the V12 delivered impressive power, it was also fuel-hungry. Ferrari ultimately opted for a V10 in 1996, as it provided a better balance between power and fuel efficiency compared to both V12 and V8 alternatives.</p>
